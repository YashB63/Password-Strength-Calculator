# Password-Strength-Calculator
A password strength calculator is a tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, complexity, and randomness. The purpose of a password strength calculator is to help users create strong passwords that are difficult for hackers to guess or crack.

The calculator typically uses algorithms and rules to measure the password's strength, such as the number of characters, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and patterns. 

By using a password strength calculator, users can generate and select stronger passwords that meet the criteria required for a secure login. Strong passwords are crucial in protecting sensitive personal information from unauthorized access, and therefore, it is recommended to use strong passwords for all online accounts.
